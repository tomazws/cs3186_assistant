When generating a DOT script, please follow the examples below:
Example 1:
DFA for r = (a|b)* is...
digraph DFA {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape = doublecircle]; q0;
    start [shape = none, label=""];
    start -> q0;
    q0 -> q0 [label = "a"];
    q0 -> q0 [label = "b"];
}

Example 2:
DFA for L(M) = {abba} is...
digraph DFA {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape = circle]; q0 q1 q2 q3;
    node [shape = doublecircle]; q4;
    start [shape = none, label=""];
    start -> q0;
    q0 -> q1 [label = "a"];
    q1 -> q2 [label = "b"];
    q2 -> q3 [label = "b"];
    q3 -> q4 [label = "a"];
}

Example 3:
DFA for L(M) = {a^n b|n ≥ 0} is...
digraph DFA {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape = circle]; q0 q2;
    node [shape = doublecircle]; q1;
    start [shape = none, label=""];
    start -> q0;
    q0 -> q0 [label = "a"];
    q0 -> q1 [label = "b"];
    q1 -> q2 [label = "a, b"];
